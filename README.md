`Monkey Roc!` is an implementation of the Monkey interpreter from [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) written in [Roc](https://roc-lang.rog).
The goal is to make a data oriented design influenced version of the interpreter for more performance.
This may not really lead to any measurable perf gains in the full interpreter due to still being a tree walking interpreter, but we shall see.
Otherwise, it should mostly just follow the features of the book.
